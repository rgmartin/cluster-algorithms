 Critical Delays In Cluster Algorithms
 
 [Final Report](https://github.com/rgmartin/cluster-algorithms/blob/main/Reduciendo%20el%20Retardamiento%20Cr%C3%ADtico%20con%20Algoritmos%20de%20Cl%C3%BAster.pdf)
 
 Metropolis Algorithm (Monte Carlo) has a critical delay when used for simulating the Ising Model near Curie Temperatures (Tc = 2.23K). This work studies the causes of this delay and the main computational algorithms that have been developed to avoid it. Comparisons between different Cluster Algorithms are presented, and against the classical Metropolis Algorithm. Both Swendesn-Wang and Wolff algorithms prove to be more efficient near Tc temperatures than Metropolis.
